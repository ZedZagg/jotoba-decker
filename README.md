# Jotoba-Decker
## Create Anki decks directly from jotoba.de

Does pretty much what it says on the short description, except that it doesn't do that yet.

## DONE
- Find references to relevant page elements as they load in
- Find and modify word nodes as they are loaded in
- Fetch details of a word through the jotoba api and add buttons to each word node to access this function
- Generate anki cards using word details from the anki backend

## TODO
- Build menu/card management system
- load previously generated anki decks
