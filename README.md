#Jotoba-Decker
##Create Anki decks directly from jotoba.de

Does pretty much what it says on the short description, except that it doesn't do that yet.

##DONE
-Find references to relevant page elements as they load in
-Find and modify word nodes as they are loaded in
-Fetch details of a word through the jotoba api and add buttons to each word node to access this function

##TODO
-Build menu/card management system
-Generate anki cards using word details from the anki backend
-Save/load previously generated anki cards
